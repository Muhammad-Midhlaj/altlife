# alt:V - Open Roleplay

---

This project now serves as a reference for RP servers in the future; all additional updates are put on hold and privatized for alt:Life. The code base up to this point is considered free but the Terms and Conditions as well as licensing still stands.

**IMPORTANT** If you are not a developer; this may not be the project for you. There is some general configuration that needs to be done and understanding code is important. This is NOT an OUT OF THE BOX gamemode. You must understand what is inside of this gamemode to get it to work properly.

## 💻 Installation

#### If you don't have NodeJS v13+; please go install it.

**Requirements:**

-   Basic Programming Fundamentals

-   Basic Problem Solving Fundementals

-   Linux (Ubuntu 18+ Preferred) or Windows 10+

-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

-   [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Postgres

#### Windows Postgres Setup

-   Run the .exe and follow the prompts.

-   Run pgAdmin

-   You will be prompted for a password. This is your database password.

-   After you need to create a database called `altv`.

-   Here's a very brief `streamable example` of that taking place.

[Here's how you do it!](https://streamable.com/oq73f)

-   **Note:** By default your username will be `postgres` and your password will be whatever you use to log in to pgAdmin4.

#### Linux Postgres Setup

-   [Follow these instructions up to step #3](https://tecadmin.net/install-postgresql-server-on-ubuntu/)

-   Type: `su - postgres`

-   Type: `psql`

-   Type: `CREATE DATABASE altv;`

-   If all is well you will see `CREATE DATABASE` or something similar replied.

-   Type: `CREATE USER stuyk WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'abc123';`

-   If all is well you will see `CREATE ROLE` replied.

-   We now have a user called `stuyk` with a password of `abc123`. We need to assign to db.

-   Type: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE altv TO stuyk;`

-   If all is well you wil see `GRANT` replied.

-   Type: `\q` to exit.

-   Type: `sudo -u root`

-   This will bring you back to your root account.

-   Now follow the rest of the steps below.

### Docker (Optional)

#### Installation using Docker

If you **do not know what docker is.** Please do not proceed any further.

OpenRP includes support for building and running the alt:V and PostgreSQL server using Docker. Included is a docker-compose.yml which contains many variables that you will need to edit. Any changes you make will require you to rebuild the altv-openrp container.

To build new containers, first edit the docker-compose.yml file and fill in all the details for the altv server and discord information, and then build with docker-compose. Note: You must agree with OpenRP terms of service by passing TOS_AGREE=true as a build argument.

```
docker-compose build --build-arg TOS_AGREE=true
```

To run the containers:

```
docker-compose up
```

Please see Docker and Docker-Compose documentation for more options.
